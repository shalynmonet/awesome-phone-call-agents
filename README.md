## Community contributions

Awesome Phone Call Agents is an early community hub for developers and workflow builders creating reusable phone-call workflows for AI agents. CALL-E SDKs, provider APIs, authentication, call execution, and provider-side controls belong upstream with CALL-E itself. This repository focuses on the community artifacts around those primitives: Agent Skills, workflow plugins, user-facing apps, examples, templates, and safety patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> New here? Start with the [`call-reminder`](skills/call-reminder/) and [`google-form-callback`](skills/google-form-callback/) skills, use [`outbound-call-skill-creator`](skills/outbound-call-skill-creator/) when you need to generate a focused outbound workflow skill, try the [`python/batch-runner`](apps/python/batch-runner/) app, and read [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md) for open community directions.

| Contribution area | Good examples | Where to contribute |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`apps/typescript/vouch`](apps/typescript/vouch/) | TypeScript / Next.js | Consent-scoped employment verification: no consent artifact, no dial. Requested vs permitted fields (California SB 1162 strips salary), third-party gatekeeper is a first-class disposition. Fixture replay by default. |
| [`apps/typescript/headcount`](apps/typescript/headcount/) | TypeScript / Next.js | CDC CASPER-style disaster household needs assessment: the unreached count is the product, voicemail is not a reach, unsupported fields strike through, and fail-closed cards go to a human. Fixture replay by default. |
| Agent Skills | Customer callbacks, appointment confirmation, lead qualification, order exception follow-up, service dispatch, incident escalation | `skills/` |
| Workflow Plugins | Dify tools, n8n nodes, Zapier actions, HubSpot workflow actions, Feishu/Lark automation nodes | `plugins/` |
| User-facing Apps | Call chat, call review console, call scheduler UI, customer callback app, business call workbench | `apps/` |

The community roadmap is a direction guide, not a fixed release plan. Small examples, platform notes, workflow sketches, templates, and focused demos are all useful.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Phone-call workflows can create real-world side effects. Please keep examples explicit, easy to inspect, safe to try without a real call when possible, and clear about phone numbers, credentials, scheduling, cancellation, and result handling.

## Why this repository exists

AI agents increasingly need to turn phone calls into reusable workflows: reminders, follow-ups, appointment coordination, provider-specific call adapters, scheduler integrations, and safety checks that other agents can install or adapt. Each entry should help an agent package, schedule, execute, or safely operate a real phone-call workflow — not act as a generic voice-agent product, telephony vendor directory, or call-center software list.

This repository focuses on three principles:

1. **Portability**: skills, apps, and adapters should be useful across agent hosts when possible.
2. **Provider separation**: the phone-call provider should place or create calls; the host scheduler should handle recurrence.
3. **Safety by default**: phone numbers, consent, credentials, and medical, legal, financial, or emergency boundaries must be handled explicitly.

## CLI reference

CALL-E CLI parameters and command flags are documented in [`cli-reference.md`](https://github.com/CALLE-AI/call-e-integrations/blob/main/packages/cli/docs/cli-reference.md).

## Templates

### Skill folder template

Use this Agent Skills folder pattern:

```text
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
├── references/
├── scripts/
└── assets/
```

### App directory template

Use `apps/` for runnable tools and demo apps:

```text
apps/
├── python/
│   └── app-name/
└── typescript/
    └── app-name/
```

Every app that can place a call or create a recurring job must document setup, side effects, cancellation, credential handling, and dry-run or preview behavior.

### Plugin directory template

Use `plugins/` for no-code and low-code workflow-platform plugins:

```text
plugins/
└── plugin-name/
    ├── README.md
    ├── manifest-or-config-file
    └── examples/
```

Every plugin should document supported triggers or actions, required inputs, side effects, credential handling, dry-run or preview behavior, and cancellation or rollback behavior when it can create calls or recurring jobs.

### README list entry template

```markdown
- [Project Name](https://example.com) - One sentence explaining why this is useful for AI-agent phone-call workflows.
```

Keep descriptions short, specific, factual, and directly tied to packaging, scheduling, executing, or safely operating AI-agent phone-call tasks.

Good: `- [call-reminder](skills/call-reminder/) - Scheduler wrapper skill for recurring CALL-E phone-call reminders.`
Avoid: `- [call-reminder](skills/call-reminder/) - A great tool for calling people!` (marketing language, no indication of what it does or how it fits the AI-agent workflow)

## Resource list

This project is an awesome list for AI-agent phone-call workflows. Add resources only when they directly help agents package, schedule, execute, or safely operate phone-call tasks.

### Skills

- [`lesson-language-phone-practice`](skills/lesson-language-phone-practice/) - Consent-gated, lesson-derived phone rehearsal with a one-minute maximum, transcript-bound formative evidence, and no automatic redial.
- [`accesscall`](skills/accesscall/) - Phone-based accessibility intake for VPAT 2.4/Section 508 audits. Run `npm install` in `skills/accesscall/` before using `scripts/format-to-vpat.js`, or it fails with `Cannot find module 'jszip'`.
- [`appointment-confirm`](skills/appointment-confirm/) - Confirms one existing appointment by phone, captures yes/no plus time as structured JSON, and leaves calendar writes to a human.
- [`cod-order-confirmation-call`](skills/cod-order-confirmation-call/) - Prepares an authorized cash-on-delivery confirmation call from order rows with an advisory result schema; validation and status changes belong to the host or a human. Dry-run preview needs no credentials.
- [`candidate-availability-call`](skills/candidate-availability-call/) - Recruiting coordination skill that confirms candidate interview availability by phone, returns evidence-backed time windows, and leaves scheduling commitments to a human.
- [`call-reminder`](skills/call-reminder/) - Scheduler wrapper skill for recurring CALL-E phone-call reminders.
- [`callparity-claimkill`](skills/callparity-claimkill/) - ClaimKill (CallParity) compiles the next CALL-E call as a leak-scored refute of a quoted claim; pytest runs on fixtures with zero live calls.
- [`carecall-intake`](skills/carecall-intake/) - Consent-aware practical-support check-ins that capture only explicit beneficiary needs and route unsafe, unsupported, or uncertain outcomes to human review.
- [`customer-onboarding-call`](skills/customer-onboarding-call/) - Welcome-call skill that turns a new signup into at most one conversation, a consent-gated structured result, and a CRM follow-up task, with evidence-backed dispositions, ordered outcome classification, per-attempt idempotency, and cancellable retries.
- [`deployment-approval-call`](skills/deployment-approval-call/) - Spoken, code-verified human approval before an agent or pipeline does something irreversible.
- [`emergency-dispatch-relay`](skills/emergency-dispatch-relay/) - Experimental, preview-first human-confirmed notification relay with an optional authorized exercise call and advisory unit-response output; not an autonomous emergency-dispatch system.
- [`holdline`](skills/holdline/) - Asks one question of many places by phone in a single dispatch and returns only the fields the transcript supports, flagging values a call reports for questions it never asked.
- [`voice-preflight`](skills/voice-preflight/) - Hear a call task spoken by your own text-to-speech provider before a real person does, then refuse a script whose critical line would not survive being spoken.
- [`dollar-consent-first-callback`](skills/dollar-consent-first-callback/) - Consent-first owner escalation after a local safety gate blocks an extreme-risk developer action; call results never grant destructive permission.
- [`email-task-call-proposal`](skills/email-task-call-proposal/) - Approval-gated channel selection for email, task, and calendar follow-ups, using CALL-E only for bounded phone-required appointment changes.
- [`forgerelay-supplier-clarification`](skills/forgerelay-supplier-clarification/) - Safe, approval-gated CALL-E workflow for collecting missing manufacturing RFQ details from authorized supplier contacts.
- [`human-context-handoff`](skills/human-context-handoff/) - Ask a verified human one bounded product, workflow, preference, or operations question, then resume an agent only from a durable structured result.
- [`holdfast`](skills/holdfast/) - Plan one approval-gated CALL-E call and check returned fields against callee-side transcript evidence. Includes a no-call parts-order walkthrough, saved evidence receipts, and review-only IVR route proposals. [Demo and testing guide](docs/holdfast/README.md).
- [`late-hold-triage`](skills/late-hold-triage/) - One CALL-E call to a guest who is already late; compares their spoken ETA to the remaining hold and returns KEEP_HOLD, RELEASE_NOW, or NEEDS_HUMAN without dialing the waitlist.
- [`language-bridge-call`](skills/language-bridge-call/) - Cross-language relay for CALL-E: one call to the recipient in their language, one call back to the requester in theirs, returning an agreed window or a fail-closed handoff.
- [`lead-qualification-call`](skills/lead-qualification-call/) - Qualifies a warm, consenting lead by phone with CALL-E, captures needs, budget, timing, decision authority, and interest as structured JSON, and routes dispositions to a human or CRM without cold outreach or unsolicited marketing.
- [`labline-critical-result`](skills/labline-critical-result/) - Safety-bounded CALL-E workflow for verified critical laboratory-result delivery with exact read-back, fail-closed disclosure rules, and human-owned clinical judgment.

- [`ground-truth-gate`](skills/ground-truth-gate/) - Pre-call triage for a physical-world claim: decides whether a call is warranted at all from scope mismatch, evidence age, and cost of being wrong, answers provisionally, then gates the fact behind one disclosed call and releases it only on positive evidence.
- [`linecanary-monitor`](skills/linecanary-monitor/) - Synthetic monitoring for phone lines and deployed voice agents: scheduled test calls, structured assertions, baseline diffing, and CI gating via the linecanary app.

- [`holdfor-post-visit-followup`](skills/holdfor-post-visit-followup/) - Post-appointment check-in call for an older patient that books nothing: it returns five enumerated answers and one verbatim quote to a review queue, stops the call rather than answer anything clinical, and places a second call into the practice's own booking line only after a named human grants a bounded authority.
- [`metapelet-elder-checkin`](skills/metapelet-elder-checkin/) - Consent-based outbound wellbeing check-in for older adults using the MetaPelet non-medical companion persona; returns mood, topics, and repeat-call interest.
- [`standby`](skills/standby/) - Fill one open shift from a standby roster with a strictly sequential call cascade that stops at the first acceptance, so a single slot cannot be double-booked; handles no-answer retry passes, callbacks, quiet hours, a shift-start cutoff, and holds the cascade for human reconciliation when a call cannot be read.
- [`service-dispatch-call`](skills/service-dispatch-call/) - Service dispatch workflow that asks a vendor about availability, ETA, and cost, returns a schema-validated result, and routes any commitment to human approval.
- [`znak-callops`](skills/znak-callops/) - CALL-E service inquiry skill with an offline checker that preserves complete provider quotations, rejects unsupported evidence, and keeps conflicting statements and unknowns visible without booking.
- [`veyra-campaign-planner`](skills/veyra-campaign-planner/) - Turns a plain-language outbound process into an approval-ready Veyra campaign brief, reviews the generated workflow, and gates live dispatch behind an exact recipient preview.
- [`calle-script-advisor`](skills/calle-script-advisor/) - Drafts and lints CALL-E call task text and result schemas for clarity, safety, and extraction quality before a call is placed.
- [`calle-invoice-recovery`](skills/calle-invoice-recovery/) - Invoice-recovery conversation and safety reference with a no-call preview; live dispatch and human approval are host responsibilities. See the [operator guide](docs/calle-invoice-recovery/).
- [`bounty-screening-call`](skills/bounty-screening-call/) - Preview-first CALL-E workflow that verifies public technical-bounty reward, AI-use, eligibility, deadline, payout, and submission facts before a human decides whether to claim or submit.
- [`research-gap-call-verifier`](skills/research-gap-call-verifier/) - Turns cited business research into an approval-gated no-call preview, then reconciles CALL-E-compatible results without mistaking voicemail, refusal, or failure for a verified fact.
- [`scope-signal`](skills/scope-signal/) - Previews and reconciles one authorized CALL-E project-brief verification call, producing transcript-evidenced GO, CAUTION, or NO-GO guidance while leaving acceptance to a human.
- [`verify-by-phone`](skills/verify-by-phone/) - Single disclosed verification call that checks a directory listing against the published line, grounds every answer in a transcript span, and abstains instead of guessing when the call does not establish one.
- [`verity-verification-core`](skills/verity-verification-core/) - Gates a CALL-E phone task's `task_completed` claim behind an independent transcript read-back before any real-world action; catches a mid-sentence self-correction, voicemail, or a value the caller never confirmed, returns ALLOW or BLOCK plus the exact value to re-confirm on a second channel, and is deterministic, no-network, and fail-closed.
- [`call-state-reconciler`](skills/call-state-reconciler/) - Works out what actually happened to a call by reading the call task, its attempts and its event stream together, and names the field behind each conclusion. Covers the states where the platform's own signals disagree.
- [`call-summarizer`](skills/call-summarizer/) - Post-call analysis skill that turns a completed CALL-E transcript into a masked, actionable brief with a one-line outcome, extracted action items with owners and due dates, caller sentiment, and a one-way caller fingerprint for de-duplicating repeat callers.
- [`ringer-consumer-tasks`](skills/ringer-consumer-tasks/) - Compose and safely place the dreaded consumer phone calls (bill negotiation, cancellation, refund, booking, quote comparison, inquiry) as CALL-E tasks with strict result schemas, dry-run-by-default previews, and human-in-the-loop decision authority.
- [`incident-escalation-call`](skills/incident-escalation-call/) - Walks an on-call escalation ladder one phone call at a time and records an acknowledgement only when an owner and an ETA are both quoted by words the recipient spoke, then re-reads the call over a second transport before the incident is reported as owned.
- [`hifi-hotel-negotiator`](skills/hifi-hotel-negotiator/) - Autonomous voice AI agent skill for hotel procurement, direct-booking rate negotiation, and reservation confirmation over the phone using CALL-E.
- [`partline-part-sourcing`](skills/partline-part-sourcing/) - Preview-first industrial replacement-part sourcing that calls approved suppliers for exact part identity, quantity and shipping cutoffs, then ranks evidence-backed matches and leaves purchase and alternate approval to a human.

- [`call-the-parts`](skills/call-the-parts/) - Sit back and relax while your CALL-E agent skill calls spare parts shops for the used automotive part you need. See [testing instructions](skills/call-the-parts/TESTING.md).
- [`warranty-recovery`](skills/warranty-recovery/) - Resolves a residual post-submission warranty-claim exception the portal, documented code and written follow-up could not explain, with one authorized call that asks for the counterparty-stated status, reason, required correction and deadline, and promotes a claim, case or credit reference only after the representative confirmed a spoken read-back, so a misheard digit downgrades the result instead of filing a correction against somebody else's case.
- [`concord-policy-audit`](skills/concord-policy-audit/) - Calls the branches an operator owns, judges each spoken answer against a written policy rubric compiled into the CALL-E result schema, and returns a branch-level gap register that carries no field capable of identifying the person who answered.
- [`ledger-collections-call`](skills/ledger-collections-call/) - HITL outbound collections call from overdue JSON (E.164, integer minor units, region); CALL-E `create` + poll; structured promise out; dry-run default; never posts to unsupported regions (including YE)
- [`rdn-intake-referral`](skills/rdn-intake-referral/) - Consent-based outbound healthcare nutrition intake that collects structured information for RDN review and referral follow-up. See [`docs/rdn-intake-referral.md`](docs/rdn-intake-referral.md) for documentation and synthetic validation examples.
- [`recall-outreach`](skills/recall-outreach/) - Calls affected customers about a product recall using only organisation-approved wording, routes every unapproved question to a human, and reports call completion and recall resolution as separate measures so a completed call is never counted as a completed return.

- [`kol-ivr-route`](skills/kol-ivr-route/) - Verifies healthcare claim-status phone call results against the question asked, payer-side field evidence, destination identity, and an independent IVR route receipt before downstream use.
- [`is-it-accessible`](skills/is-it-accessible/) - Calls a venue with the accessibility questions that matter to one person (step count at the door, toilet on the same floor, hearing loop, guide dogs) and returns a per-need verdict backed by a direct quote; an unevidenced or hedged "yes" is recorded as unknown, never as a pass. Dry run by default, no dependencies until `--real`.
- [`pharmacy-cash-price`](skills/pharmacy-cash-price/) - Asks one retail pharmacy for a cash price with no insurance and returns a structured quote, a refusal, or an explicit unknown, with the disclosure and the medical boundary written into the call.
- [`logistics-exception`](skills/logistics-exception/) - Resolves a missed dock window by calling the driver and receiving dock concurrently with one strict CALL-E result schema, reconciling terminal results by event id and re-fetch, combining only reached-contact facts into a recovery card, and gating any dock-changing follow-up call behind explicit human approval.
- [`otherend-task-test`](skills/otherend-task-test/) - Rehearses a CALL-E task text and result schema against a programmable receptionist line the operator owns, reads the deterministic grade (manifest, self-report, fabrication, disclosure, confidence calibration), and turns each failing check into a task-text edit before the task reaches real people.

- [`route-readiness-call`](skills/route-readiness-call/) - Calls the next customer on a delivery route shortly before the rider arrives, accepts the readiness answer only when the customer's own words back it, and turns it into an earliest delivery time for re-ordering the remaining stops, with one call in flight and no redial.
- [`dispute-evidence-call`](skills/dispute-evidence-call/) - Places one disclosed phone call to a customer who disputed a card charge and uses the answers as chargeback evidence only when the transcript shows the customer said them; a reported no stops the filing, and nothing retries or redials on its own.
- [`landmark-navigation-assist`](skills/landmark-navigation-assist/) - Builds a CALL-E outbound task that guides a delivery driver through the last few hundred metres to a building using a reusable, landmark-based location config instead of GPS or postal text, with driver-confirmed, in-call-only escalation.
- [`positive-contact-call`](skills/positive-contact-call/) - Disclosed critical-notice call that confirms a live human acknowledged the message, treats voicemail as unconfirmed, and returns a fail-closed disposition for an escalation ladder.
- [`no-show-shield`](skills/no-show-shield/) - Calls every booking on a given day to confirm it, writes yes/reschedule/cancel outcomes back to the operator's calendar, and returns a short list of only the slots that still need a human.
- [`exception-resolution-calls`](skills/exception-resolution-calls/) - Resolves a blocked business workflow by phone (e.g. an overdue purchase-order acknowledgement), turning one CALL-E call task into per-recipient structured evidence and a deterministic state change. Gates any closing outcome on a self-reported `spoke_with` identity field, since an authorized phone number is not an authorized person, and differentiates escalation reasons instead of one generic needs-human flag; complements `exception-resolver`'s always-human-approval pattern by fully automating the unambiguous cases and escalating only what genuinely needs a person.
- [`supply-chain-supplier-status`](skills/supply-chain-supplier-status/) - Autonomous outbound phone calls to suppliers to verify purchase order fulfillment, capture delay causes, calculate financial risk, and sync procurement records.

### Apps

- [Callstack](https://github.com/RolexAlexander/callstack) - External codebase-ingesting technical support agent that reads repository documentation/source and proposes a CALL-E support-call task. The author reports previews against two repositories and one owned-destination live test; broad correctness is not independently established. No-call preview is the default; a real call requires an explicit `--dispatch` flag after human review of the diagnosis and call task.
- [CallIQ](https://github.com/kk590/CallIQ) - Experimental offline sales-call workflow simulator for rehearsing lead qualification, objection handling, meeting booking, and local CRM updates; it does not place real calls or mutate a live CRM.

- [Kordy](https://github.com/vimzh/kordy) - External Next.js event-monitoring app that compiles plain-language triggers, filters connected-source events, and places contextual CALL-E calls after a trigger match or explicit demo invocation; Gmail replies require spoken approval, and dry-run tests intercept call transport.
- [Tokito](https://github.com/vimzh/tokito) - Built for small teams tired of chasing ignored Google Forms, Tokito uses CALL-E to conduct adaptive phone conversations, ask intelligent follow-ups, and turn honest responses into evidence-backed insights they can act on.

- [TeamLine](apps/typescript/teamline/) - Coach-authorized CALL-E workflow that gathers operational facts, pauses for a human decision, and communicates the approved outcome; sandbox/no-call mode is the default. [Demo](https://teamline-judge-console.netlify.app/teamline/demo) · [Video](https://youtu.be/2btXyqeA3Wg)
- [VINRelease](apps/typescript/vinrelease/) - Evidence-first dealership title exception workflow that binds each CALL-E call to an approved disclosure packet and advances only from strict structured results, with a two-call no-call replay by default.
- [Clarity](apps/typescript/clarity/) - Clarifies one ambiguous job-application claim through an adaptive CALL-E phone call, returning transcript-backed facts and unresolved questions, with a no-call replay default. [Demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eHWqBgilrI)
- [HippoHomes](https://www.hippo-homes.com) - Apartment-hunting app that prepares user-approved CALL-E call briefs to verify listing availability, ask missing questions, and request viewing appointments while keeping the renter in control.
- [Fraud Ops Caller](apps/typescript/fraud-ops-caller/) - Pack-fired fraud-ops desk (KYC, evidence, collections, merchant) with stub dial by default, masked plan destinations, and live CALL-E gated by operator secret, pinned origin, and confirm phrase.
- [CallPermit](apps/typescript/callpermit/) - Bounded appointment calls where CALL-E handles the conversation, a Tethers-backed envelope decides permission before dispatch, and provider evidence is reconciled against the same authority; deterministic no-call mode by default.
- [OneReach service follow-up](apps/typescript/onereach-service-followup/) - Turns an authorized CALL-E service appointment conversation into a validated Operations handoff, with a no-call default and standalone public integration example.

- [OpenLine Screening](apps/typescript/openline-screening/) - Recruiter console that places the first-round CALL-E screening call to each shortlisted candidate with a fixed disclosure-and-consent script, a three-pass prohibited-topic guard, and strict structured results; a person decides Interview or Reject, and the no-call fake mode runs the whole loop.
- [Sparbird](apps/typescript/sparbird/) - Rings your own phone, plays the person you have to win over, and quotes back the line that lost them, with a recorded no-call default.
- [Audition Agent](apps/python/audition-agent/) - Producer-reviewed CALL-E role-disclosure calls that collect performer interest, callback availability, and unanswered questions, with a no-call verification path.
- [SupplyCall AI](apps/web/supplycall-ai/) - Procurement exception recovery that uses CALL-E to confirm a missing PO with the supplier, then applies deterministic resolve/escalate rules, with Vitest no-call verification.
- [DeskHelp](apps/web/deskhelp/) - Hands an office's weekly call list to CALL-E and reports what each call settled: fourteen workflows ready to switch on, approved wording only, every other question captured in the caller's own words and answered on the next call, promises kept as promises, and no answer stored unless the recipient's own words back it.
- [CallParity](https://github.com/ruddro-roy/callparity) - Two-call ops workbench for Party A claims, a Party B falsification CALL-E task, and a merged claim graph. Preview and fixture mode by default.
- [CallmeMaybe](https://github.com/jongan69/callmemaybe) - Shopify order-exception phone workflows that use CALL-E for carrier traces and consent-first customer callbacks, with a no-call fixture mode and merchant approval before every Shopify mutation.
- [Centre Remix](apps/web/centre-remix/) - SAMPLE Harbour Place leasing board with WebMCP tools and an honestly fake-only CALL-E-shaped wrap (`place_tenant_call`); public Netlify demo never dials; reserved SAMPLE phones only. [Live](https://ornate-pie-10561d.netlify.app)

| [`apps/web/asheard`](apps/web/asheard/) | TypeScript / Next.js | Reads what actually happened to a call as three separate answers rather than one status word, shows the field behind every sentence, and ranks a batch by what costs something if ignored. |
| [`apps/web/callproof`](apps/web/callproof/) | Ruby / Python | Closed-loop CALL-E workflow that checks transcript evidence against an immutable call contract and routes policy exceptions to persisted AgentKit human review. |
| [`apps/web/centre-remix`](apps/web/centre-remix/) | JavaScript / Node | SAMPLE shopping-centre leasing board: humans and agents share one floor plan; `place_tenant_call` writes honestly fake-only CALL-E-shaped fixtures (public function never dials; reserved SAMPLE phones; masked responses). |
| [`apps/typescript/evidence-grounded-callback`](apps/typescript/evidence-grounded-callback/) | TypeScript | Compiles owner-reviewed source evidence and positive callback consent into a masked CALL-E preview and separately gated MCP plan. |
| [`apps/typescript/kincall`](apps/typescript/kincall/) | TypeScript | Consent-first check-in and trusted-circle coordination: a stated request for help overrides the agent's own judgement, contacts are called one at a time until somebody commits, and the monitored person is called back with the outcome. |
| [`apps/typescript/revisit-zero`](apps/typescript/revisit-zero/) | TypeScript | Controlled meter-access recovery workbench with deterministic safety gates, exact call approval, one-recipient CALL-E execution, strict structured-result validation, and human-approved rebook export. |
| [`apps/typescript/verify-contact-claim`](apps/typescript/verify-contact-claim/) | TypeScript | Contact-claim verifier for a suspicious voicemail, text or missed call: dials only the number printed on the customer's own card, asks whether that contact was genuine and returns the words that came back with a hash-chained record. |

| [`apps/typescript/callsuite`](apps/typescript/callsuite/) | TypeScript | Checks versioned CALL-E task instructions against required business disclosures, blocks unsafe changes, and provides a complete no-call judge demo with reviewed evidence. |
| [`apps/typescript/connected`](apps/typescript/connected/) | TypeScript | AI phone companion whose consented recurring conversations remember interests and family stories, revisit them naturally, and offer human-reviewed event reminders or community introductions. |
| [`apps/typescript/linecanary`](apps/typescript/linecanary/) | TypeScript | Synthetic monitoring and CI regression testing for business phone lines and voice agents: ownership-verified scheduled test calls, schema and timing assertions, baseline regression diffing, Slack alerts, and a GitHub Action. |
| [`apps/typescript/phone-approval-gate`](apps/typescript/phone-approval-gate/) | TypeScript | Phone-verified approval gate for irreversible automation, with a one-time spoken code, an escalation ladder, dual control and a verifiable approval record. |
| [`apps/typescript/voice-preflight`](apps/typescript/voice-preflight/) | TypeScript | Renders a call task through any text-to-speech API you already pay for so you hear it before the callee does, then refuses a script whose declared critical line has gone missing, whose voice cannot speak the recipient's language or whose measured audio overruns its budget. |
| [`apps/typescript/call-on-behalf`](apps/typescript/call-on-behalf/) | TypeScript | Delegated errand caller with a disclosure budget: says only the details the person authorized, commits only inside authorized windows, and returns the answers plus the transcript. |

| [`apps/typescript/capacityline`](apps/typescript/capacityline/) | TypeScript | Consent-first manufacturing supply recovery desk that calls approved backup suppliers, returns transcript-grounded quantity and delivery commitments, fails closed against buyer guardrails, and requires human approval before an RFQ handoff. |
| [`apps/typescript/procurepulse`](apps/typescript/procurepulse/) | TypeScript / Node | Urgent supplier quote race: identical CALL-E questions to authorized suppliers, one strict per-recipient result schema, unit-aware deterministic ranking that turns vague answers into needs-review instead of numbers, and human-gated internal approval and non-purchase hold calls; preview and loopback fake-server paths by default. |
| [`apps/python/accessline`](apps/python/accessline/) | Python | Consent-first venue accessibility verification with disclosed automation, three fixed factual questions, CALL-E REST polling, schema-valid structured results, uncertainty preservation, and a no-call mock CLI by default. |
| [`apps/python/aftercare`](apps/python/aftercare/) | Python | Consent-aware post-discharge CALL-E follow-ups with protocol schemas, dry-run by default, risk scoring, and a clinic UI. |
| [`apps/python/appointment-confirm`](apps/python/appointment-confirm/) | Python | Consent-first appointment confirmation with a no-call preview, fixture mock, and one-shot CALL-E execute path that returns yes/no + time as fail-closed JSON. |
| [`apps/python/blood-bank-dispatch`](apps/python/blood-bank-dispatch/) | Python | Parallel blood-stock enquiry that dials every blood bank at once on CALL-E, extracts a strict availability schema with `unknown` preserved as an answer, and returns a shortlist for a human to act on. |
| [`apps/python/leash`](apps/python/leash/) | Python | Revokes an unattended agent's Google credential unless one call clears twelve conditions; silence, a machine answering, or a result that disagrees with its own transcript all end the lease. |
| [`apps/typescript/recallready`](apps/typescript/recallready/) | TypeScript | Consent-gated product-recall qualification calls grounded in official CPSC records, with masked destinations, single-use previews, structured remedies, and a no-call default. |
| [`apps/typescript/readyline`](apps/typescript/readyline/) | TypeScript | Event load-in coordinator that turns authorized CALL-E vendor results into deterministic access, dock, power, and deadline checks, with a no-call demo and human-approved follow-up. |

| [`apps/python/hungrycall-cascade`](apps/python/hungrycall-cascade/) | Python | Sequential call cascade that stops at the first candidate meeting every must and boundary, with staged concessions treated as an authorisation and unknown outcomes halting the run. |
| [`apps/python/researchcall-survey`](apps/python/researchcall-survey/) | Python | Standardized survey runner with a reproducible seeded sample, locked ethics rules, raw answers kept beside their coded category, and completion measured against everyone drawn. |
| [`apps/python/ringedingeding`](apps/python/ringedingeding/) | Python | Multi-recipient response aggregator that keeps answered, refused and unreached apart, reports every share against those who answered, and never reads silence as consent. |
| [`apps/typescript/multi-party-scheduler`](apps/typescript/multi-party-scheduler/) | TypeScript | Two-phase appointment scheduling over phone calls: gather availability, confirm one time with everybody by voice, release everybody who confirmed when the commit fails and resume an interrupted run. |
| [`apps/python/callback-coordinator`](apps/python/callback-coordinator/) | Python | Consent-first callback triage and routing: one CALL-E call learns why a person needs a callback, classifies the outcome into a fail-closed disposition, and routes it to the right team. |
| [`apps/python/callback-window-coordinator`](apps/python/callback-window-coordinator/) | Python | Consent-first callback-window coordinator with masked preview, stable idempotency, and structured CALL-E results. |
| [`apps/python/cloud-steward-incident-callback`](apps/python/cloud-steward-incident-callback/) | Python | Preview-first on-call incident notification that preserves Cloud Steward's separate approval boundary. |
| [`apps/python/partline`](apps/python/partline/) | Python | Dry-run-first industrial replacement-part sourcing that calls approved suppliers, checks exact matches against the original request and keeps purchases and alternate approval human-owned. |
| [`apps/python/concord`](apps/python/concord/) | Python | Preview-first branch policy auditing that rules on the value a call extracted rather than the transcript, treats unreached branches and hedged answers as unresolved, and reports on locations rather than staff. |
| [`apps/python/webhook-result-receiver`](apps/python/webhook-result-receiver/) | Python | Durable at-least-once CALL-E terminal webhook ingestion with SQLite deduplication, conflict detection, and authenticated Calls API reconciliation. |
| [`apps/python/lead-follow-up-booking`](apps/python/lead-follow-up-booking/) | Python | Consent-first lead follow-up booking: a disclosed AI call offers only calendar-confirmed free slots and books a Google Calendar event only when the lead picks a time on the call. |
| [`apps/python/callflow-campaign-runner`](apps/python/callflow-campaign-runner/) | Python | CSV-driven outbound campaign runner that triages structured results into auto-closed, retry, and needs-human queues. |
| [`apps/python/mobilize`](apps/python/mobilize/) | Python | Parallel wave dispatch to a consented pool under a deadline: stops calling the moment enough people confirm, and scores how firm each "yes" actually is instead of trusting every stated agreement. Ships a 300-trial zero-cost evaluation harness with a measured accuracy result, a crash-safe ledger, and an MCP server. |
| [`apps/python/batch-runner`](apps/python/batch-runner/) | Python | JSONL batch runner using CALL-E CLI auth state, FastMCP, Rich output, and MCP tool-call metadata. |
| [`apps/python/broker-login-client`](apps/python/broker-login-client/) | Python | CALL-E brokered login client with local token cache and MCP HTTP calls. |
| [`apps/typescript/broker-login-client`](apps/typescript/broker-login-client/) | TypeScript | CALL-E brokered login client using `@call-e/core`. |
| [`apps/typescript/broker-login-client-standalone`](apps/typescript/broker-login-client-standalone/) | TypeScript | CALL-E brokered login client without a shared package dependency. |
| [`apps/python/oauth-login-client`](apps/python/oauth-login-client/) | Python | CALL-E OAuth login client for MCP Streamable HTTP. |
| [`apps/python/metapelet-checkin`](apps/python/metapelet-checkin/) | Python | Preview-first runner for one MetaPelet-style CALL-E check-in with structured post-call summary. |
| [`apps/python/holdfor-board`](apps/python/holdfor-board/) | Python | Post-visit check-in calls to older patients that book nothing: each call returns five bounded answers and one verbatim sentence to a review queue, where a named person grants a bounded authority before a second call carries her own words to the practice's booking line. A reviewer may shorten what she said and never widen it, checked server-side on the exact substring; a red-flag phrase is scanned for deterministically as well as prompted against; and a refusal is filed as a refusal rather than a call to retry. Fake transcripts by default, so the whole board runs without dialling. |
| [`apps/typescript/oauth-login-client`](apps/typescript/oauth-login-client/) | TypeScript | CALL-E OAuth login client for MCP Streamable HTTP. |
| [`apps/typescript/vibehub-founder-relay`](apps/typescript/vibehub-founder-relay/) | TypeScript | Consent-first founder-match readiness call with masked preview, stable idempotency, and structured CALL-E results. |
| [`apps/typescript/openings`](apps/typescript/openings/) | TypeScript | Standing availability watch for care access: calls the healthcare providers actually listed in directories to verify who is real, who takes your plan, and who has an opening, then keeps watching on a decaying cadence until a slot opens. |
| [`apps/typescript/ringer`](apps/typescript/ringer/) | TypeScript | Consumer web app that turns dreaded phone tasks — bill negotiation, cancellations, bookings, refunds, and multi-business quote comparison — into consent-first, multilingual CALL-E workflows with strict per-call and per-recipient result schemas, human-in-the-loop decision authority, evidence-gated and denominator-honest outcomes, and a no-call demo mode by default. |
| [`apps/web/local-atlas`](apps/web/local-atlas/) | JavaScript / Node | Map-first local guide where one confirmed call becomes a dated, evidence-quoted fact every later visitor reuses: stored answers, opinion refusal, closed-business and calling-window checks all work to avoid placing a call at all, results keep their uncertainty and expire by outcome, and private results are written where the public list cannot read them. A comparison across two or three nearby places is one multi-recipient task, with each business answering for itself and the cross-call verdict marked as derived rather than quoted. |
| [`apps/typescript/dispatch-pulse`](apps/typescript/dispatch-pulse/) | TypeScript | Real-time logistics command center for automated pre-delivery recipient phone verification, estate gate code extraction, and live SSE event streaming. |
| [`apps/typescript/routeready`](apps/typescript/routeready/) | TypeScript | Call-ahead route re-sequencing: phones the next customers while the rider is still riding, gates each answer on the customer's own words, re-orders the remaining stops with an exact search, and shows the rider one instruction; simulated day and no-call tests by default, live calls behind an environment switch, a start token and a consent statement. |
| [`apps/typescript/sundials`](apps/typescript/sundials/) | TypeScript | Agentic toolchain (embeddable SDK, backend, and dashboard) that helps high-ticket businesses **call while the lead is warm**. Sundials use Goal-oriented CALL-E agents with web interaction context to boost lead conversion. |
| [`apps/python/kept`](apps/python/kept/) | Python | Turns a payment promise made on a collections call into a validated financial record: eleven named rejection reasons stand between a spoken sentence and a ledger entry, vague amounts are refused, over-commitments are clamped to the invoice balance with the spoken figure kept beside them, and the promise is reconciled against the bank feed a week later so only the commitments that actually broke are called again. |
| [`python/warrantyops`](apps/python/warrantyops/) | Python | Post-submission warranty-claim exception resolver whose most dangerous field is guarded by its own state machine: a claim, case or credit reference stays UNCONFIRMED until a read-back is performed, answered affirmatively, and that answer is found in the counterparty's own transcript turns, and extraction confidence is not an accepted input. Transport failure never becomes a claim status, a stale source version never receives a write-back, and the default path replays synthetic fixtures with zero calls. |
| [`apps/typescript/callsweep`](apps/typescript/callsweep/) | TypeScript | Calls many local businesses, haggles each one down toward your budget on the call, ranks their offers by the best overall deal (price, what's included, availability), and books the one you pick. Dry-run no-call path by default with fictional sample shops. |
| [`apps/typescript/arc-platform`](apps/typescript/arc-platform/) | TypeScript | Approval-gated radio and creator rate calls that read the quoted figure back digit by digit and record nothing as confirmed without a spoken yes; simulated by default when no API key is set, with duplicate-call protection and a masked, published call archive. |
| [`apps/python/casechaser`](apps/python/casechaser/) | Python | Chases an open claim, refund, repair, or delivery case to closure: every company promise becomes a dated, quoted commitment, broken ones climb a fixed escalation ladder, offers and denials stop at the customer, and a masked evidence pack is ready for the written complaint. Fixture mode by default. |
| [`apps/python/claimcall`](apps/python/claimcall/) | Python | Human-approved airline disruption resolution: identifies missing case facts, turns them into bounded CALL-E objectives, and converts the call into structured commitments, evidence, before/after case state, and the traveller's next action. Synthetic no-call mode by default. |
| [`apps/typescript/supplyline`](apps/typescript/supplyline/) | TypeScript | Multi-round freight-rate sourcing agent: sequential CALL-E quote calls to carriers, then a callback to the highest bidder to negotiate against the best competing quote, with a dry-run no-call mode by default. |
| [`apps/web/supplycall-ai`](apps/web/supplycall-ai/) | TypeScript / Next.js | Catalog pointer to SupplyCall AI. Procurement exception recovery: one CALL-E supplier confirmation call, deterministic resolve/escalate rules, shared-number-pool outbound, and Vitest no-call verification. |
| [`apps/typescript/verity-verification-core`](apps/typescript/verity-verification-core/) | TypeScript | Standalone dry-run gate for a CALL-E task's `task_completed` claim: re-reads the transcript with a deterministic grammar, checks the parsed value against what the action would write, requires an in-transcript confirmation and a fresh resource re-check, and returns ALLOW or BLOCK plus a value to re-confirm on a second channel. No calls placed by default; fail-closed. |
| [`apps/python/reality-resolver`](apps/python/reality-resolver/) | Python | Decides whether a call is needed at all before placing one: four generic rules score the evidence for a decision-critical contradiction, a compliance gate applies only the rules that actually apply to the case's use case, and CALL-E's structured result is reconciled back against the original evidence so that voicemail, an IVR, or an unclear answer is escalated for human review rather than actioned as a cancellation. Two use cases ship on the same engine; fake-server dry run by default. |
| [`apps/typescript/navigator-outreach-safety-example`](apps/typescript/navigator-outreach-safety-example/) | TypeScript | Consent-first, fail-closed CALL-E companion demonstrating SDK import, permanent no-call safeguards, fictional mock behavior, and judge-facing evidence boundaries. Live outbound validation is not claimed. |
| [`apps/python/afterword`](apps/python/afterword/) | Python | Death notification to the institutions that have to be told: one call per institution captures the department, the documents, whether a certified copy is accepted and what happens to the direct debits, then returns a single printable pack. Contradictions against a prior call or the recorded policy are marked disputed with both sides kept rather than resolved, a refusal to speak to anybody but the executor is reported as a normal outcome, and the agent can close nothing, cancel nothing and accept nothing. Scripted no-call demo by default. |
| [`apps/python/muster`](apps/python/muster/) | Python | Proof-of-life attestation for pension and benefit schemes: a freshness challenge minted per call that a recording cannot answer, knowledge prompts a housemate should not know, and turn-timing analysis that catches somebody in the room feeding the answers. A relative vouching for the subject is never a pass, no grade ever concludes a death, and nothing it returns can stop a payment. Scripted no-call demo by default. |
| [`apps/typescript/muster-phone-to-report`](apps/typescript/muster-phone-to-report/) | TypeScript | Turns synthetic greenhouse phone reports into evidence-backed readings with a review dashboard, credential-free scenario replay, and an opt-in CALL-E integration. |
| [`apps/python/sticker`](apps/python/sticker/) | Python | Finds out what a prescription actually costs in cash by calling licensed community pharmacies near a ZIP and asking one question, then prices every answer against the national average acquisition cost CMS publishes weekly, so a quote can be judged and not merely compared. Refusals stay in the denominator, a quote for a different bottle size is reported and never rescaled, and discovery never dials: live calls read an explicit per-destination allowlist. Simulated by default. |
| [`apps/python/otherend`](apps/python/otherend/) | Python | Task pre-flight for a CALL-E task: CALL-E dials a programmable line you own that answers as a receptionist with a chosen adversity profile, or as a scripted person for tasks that call people, then a deterministic grader scores what CALL-E reported (`task_completed`, `structured_result`, confidence, AI disclosure) against what the line actually said. Replays nine synthetic rows (in-process simulation, no calls) with no keys by default, including another entry's task text run verbatim; one real call per row only behind `--yes` and an allow-list. |
| [`apps/python/dialtone`](apps/python/dialtone/) | Python | For calls where the other end is also an AI: a spoken handshake compiled into the CALL-E task, a human / IVR / agent detector with a published blind evaluation, and an attestation gate that refuses bookings two agents "confirmed" without any person or record behind them. |
| [`apps/python/pawpassage`](apps/python/pawpassage/) | Python | Approval-bound pet-journey evidence checks with an official SDK loopback demo, one-call intent tracking, and read-only recovery. |
| [`apps/typescript/continuum-call`](apps/typescript/continuum-call/) | TypeScript | Durable multi-call phone missions: a frozen intent plus a one-create reservation mean an unresolved or refused outcome blocks the next call instead of redialling, confirmed facts carry their source run into the next party's call, and a hash-chained Evidence Pack replays the mission and fails closed on tampering. Interactive mock is the default; live CALL-E is opt-in behind named operator gates. |
| [`apps/python/ringdown`](apps/python/ringdown/) | Python | On-call escalation that phones the pager holder one rung at a time and only counts a page as acknowledged when an owner and an ETA are each quoted by a span the recipient actually spoke. The call is placed over REST and re-read over MCP, because verifying through the channel that wrote proves nothing, and every verdict is sealed in a hash-chained ledger that re-derives it offline months later. Alert payloads arrive through a mapping file, so PagerDuty and Opsgenie cost no vendor code; a model can draft that file, and the deterministic loader decides whether the draft is admissible. Preview is the default and nothing dials without an explicit confirmation phrase. |

- [VERIFY](https://github.com/DivineDomokuma10/verifyam) - Disclosed listing-verification app that calls the agent or landlord behind a rental ad and returns a schema-validated transcript-backed claim (Verified/Warning/Inconclusive) with transcript evidence and an optional mock mode. Verdicts represent transcript-supported assessments, not independent authority verification.
| [`apps/python/positive-contact`](apps/python/positive-contact/) | Python | PSPS Medical Baseline live-contact confirmation with a safe support loop: disclosed CALL-E calls, transcript-evidenced acknowledgement, retry and alternate-contact ladder, operator-approved identity-free supplier availability calls, field-visit work orders and denominator-honest reporting. Fixture mode by default. |

The default e2e tests use a local fake broker/OAuth/MCP server or dry-run paths, so they do not require real CALL-E credentials or browser login. Live verification is opt-in in each app README.
- [callhook](apps/go/callhook/) - Event-driven CALL-E calling platform: webhook in, structured outcome back, with goal-driven campaigns that early-stop, 19 doc-verified platform integrations, an MCP server, and a war-room UI in one zero-dependency Go binary. Dry-run by default. [Demo](https://callhook.onrender.com) · [Video](https://youtu.be/66siB3kIYMk)


### Community apps

- [Openline](https://openlinecall.vercel.app/) - Human-approved service-availability verification app that turns a request into an inspectable CALL-E phone plan and returns evidence-backed next steps, with a no-call simulation path. ([repository](https://github.com/Datwebguy/openline))

Externally hosted user-facing apps built on CALL-E. They live in their own repositories, so review their setup, credential handling, and call side effects before running them.

- [FrontDesk Phone Follow-Through](https://github.com/TayseerLaz/frontdesk-core) - Cash-on-delivery order confirmation calls inside a multi-tenant WhatsApp AI front desk: chat orders are confirmed by a CALL-E call briefed from the real order rows, results written back to the order and the inbox thread; dry-run default, verified-number override, per-tenant daily cap. See the [integration notes](docs/community-apps/frontdesk-phone-follow-through.md).
- [Care Call AI](https://github.com/NeoSPU/care-call-ai) - Practical-support outreach app for charities with approved CALL-E rounds, no-call preflight, operator gates, and reviewed request/order handoff. [Demo video](https://youtu.be/Hc2bWjTnKFQ) · [Integration notes](docs/community-apps/care-call-ai.md).
- [ProofMesh](https://github.com/fokrulanthro16-eng/proofmesh) - A consent-first CALL-E phone verification platform that turns supervised conversations into auditable, machine-readable facts with human approval, regional controls, and honest uncertainty handling. See the [integration notes](docs/community-apps/proofmesh.md).

- [PagerZero](https://pagerzero.pro) - Experimental SRE voice-approval demo using in-memory simulated infrastructure and a demo PIN, not production remediation or zero-trust authentication; use credential-free simulator mode, since configured CALL-E keys can enable real calls. See the [integration notes](docs/community-apps/pagerzero.md) and [GitHub](https://github.com/adamm285-dev/pagerzeropro).
- [Auto Property Manager](https://autopropertymanager.com) - Author-described hosted rental-management app using CALL-E for owner-alert and contractor-dispatch calls; its optional consent-gated rehearsal makes real calls to an operator-controlled destination, while read-only inspection requires no send. See the [integration notes](docs/community-apps/auto-property-manager.md).
- [RxScout](https://github.com/prkshverma09/RxScout) - Experimental pharmacy-availability simulation with optional CALL-E and SMS integrations; evaluate only in credential-free sandbox, and do not treat its live queue as unattended-safe or its extracted stock information as verified medical guidance. See the [integration notes](docs/community-apps/rxscout.md).
- [LastCall Materials](https://lastcall-materials.fly.dev/) - A deadline-first construction-material reuse workflow that uses one authorized CALL-E capacity call, converts partial quantities into evidence-backed candidates, and keeps approval and verified pickup human-controlled. The public demo is fixture-only. See the [integration notes](docs/community-apps/lastcall-materials.md).
- [DischargePulse](https://github.com/Temake/DischargePulse) - Hospital discharge placement agent that calls skilled nursing facility admissions lines through CALL-E, verifies each care requirement from a runtime result schema, re-plans when a facility contradicts its directory record, and stops at a human approval gate, with replay and scripted no-call modes. See the [integration notes](docs/community-apps/dischargepulse.md).

- [Off the Hook: The Memory Line](https://github.com/tivastreasures-ops/off-the-hook) - Operator-character message-taking line: CALL-E conducts an in-character disclosed-automation call (free tier) that can terminate on a physical rotary phone via SIP/ATA, with structured results rendered as a keepsake Message Slip; paid tier adds a custom ElevenLabs voice, Stripe billing, and email-keyed call balances. Live:[The Memory Line](https://off-the-hook.replit.app)

- [Vera](https://github.com/shalynmonet/vera) - Strands-orchestrated wellness companion that places recurring CALL-E calls to seniors, evaluates outcomes with Amazon Bedrock against each resident's own escalation criteria, and alerts caregivers automatically when something needs attention.
### Plugins

No-code and low-code workflow plugins live under [`plugins/`](plugins/). They are for workflow-platform nodes, actions, connectors, and recipes that help operators connect business events to phone-call agent workflows without writing a full app.

Plugins should be explicit about inputs, outbound call side effects, credential handling, preview or dry-run behavior, and how a workflow builder can disable or roll back the integration.

| Plugin | Platform | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`plugins/n8n-calle-api`](plugins/n8n-calle-api/) | n8n | Importable CALL-E API workflow template for one-by-one outbound calls, metadata round trips, call status signals, transcripts, summaries, and structured results. |
| [`plugins/n8n-nodes-calle`](plugins/n8n-nodes-calle/) | n8n | Documentation-only pointer to the standalone `@call-e/n8n-nodes-calle` community node package for native outbound-call nodes. |
| [`plugins/dify-template`](plugins/dify-template/) | Dify | Importable Dify workflow DSL template for a one-shot outbound call tool with dry-run preview, API health gating, and masked results. |
| [`plugins/hubspot-calle`](plugins/hubspot-calle/) | HubSpot | Static HubSpot Projects app for creating CALL-E call tasks from CRM records and workflow App Cards. |
| [`plugins/zapier-calle`](plugins/zapier-calle/) | Zapier | Zapier Platform CLI integration for outbound CALL-E calls with callback-based waiting, fail-closed dispositions, dry-run preview, and payload-derived idempotency keys. |
| [`plugins/slack-calle-bridge`](plugins/slack-calle-bridge/) | Slack | Signed slash-command bridge for previewing and explicitly confirming one CALL-E phone task, with masked structured results and deterministic retry protection. |

### Safety patterns

- [`CallSentinel design reference`](docs/call-sentinel/) - Documentation-only concept for advisory phone-call transcript anomaly scoring and a proposed MCP interface; no local application is included.
- [`Production workflow guide`](docs/production-workflows.md) - Application-owned state, stable idempotency, durable webhook processing, result verification, retry ownership, and privacy-minimized audit patterns for consequential phone workflows.
- [`Safety reference`](skills/call-reminder/references/safety.md) - Consent, E.164 phone-number handling, credential boundaries, cancellation, duplicate-job prevention, and medical reminder boundaries.
- [`Dispatch safety reference`](skills/service-dispatch-call/references/safety.md) - Purpose-bound authorization, third-party privacy on outbound calls, the commitment boundary between gathering an answer and accepting it, and retention limits on transcripts and spoken values.
- [`Ambiguous outcome handling`](skills/service-dispatch-call/references/ambiguous-outcomes.md) - Why an unknown call outcome is a state to reconcile rather than an error to retry, and how client timeouts cause duplicate calls.
- [`Idempotency reference`](skills/service-dispatch-call/references/idempotency.md) - Deriving call idempotency keys from the authorization rather than the attempt, reserving before dialling, and replay-safe webhook handling.
- [`Approval threat model`](apps/typescript/phone-approval-gate/docs/threat-model.md) - What a phone approval proves and does not prove, out-of-band secret handling, and why the phone network is a restricted verification channel.
- [`Accept live, verify after`](docs/adr/0007-the-agent-accepts-the-board-checks-the-acceptance.md) - Why an agent may accept an offer while a receptionist waits, and why what it accepted is then read again deterministically against the authorisation that allowed the call, so "only inside the envelope" is a property of the code rather than a request made of a model.
- [`Disclosure budget`](apps/typescript/call-on-behalf/docs/privacy-budget.md) - Authorizing what a caller may say about a person, checking the script before the call and checking what was actually said after it.
- [`Contact-claim limits`](apps/typescript/verify-contact-claim/docs/limits.md) - Why an institution refusing to confirm a contact is the expected outcome, what a confirmed contact still does not prove and what has never been tested live.
- [`Line-ownership verification`](apps/typescript/linecanary/docs/compliance.md) - Why a monitoring tool must prove control of a line before calling it, greeting-token verification, attestation for client lines, and proportionate check frequency.
- [`Provider descriptors`](apps/typescript/voice-preflight/docs/providers.md) - How one HTTP client drives any text-to-speech API from a JSON file, where the audio sits in a response, plus the order in which a run refuses so a failure says what has already happened.
- [`Onboarding call safety`](skills/customer-onboarding-call/references/safety.md) - Consent and recording disclosure, refusal suppression, content boundaries for price and policy claims, working-hours limits, and honest not-reached reporting.
- [`International routing`](skills/customer-onboarding-call/references/international-routing.md) - Forwarding pattern for unsupported regions, distinguishing congestion from no-answer from unsupported destination, and handling providers that report failure then dial anyway.
- [`Calls not placed`](apps/web/local-atlas/docs/calls-not-placed.md) - Refusing before dialling: reusing a stored answer, rejecting questions a phone cannot answer, closed-business and calling-window checks, and defaulting to simulated when no access code is configured.
- [`Fact freshness`](apps/web/local-atlas/docs/fact-freshness.md) - Expiring a call result by outcome so failures are not cached as conclusions, keeping hedges and refusals distinct from answers, and defeating idempotent replay when a reader rechecks.
- [`What a call can establish`](apps/python/muster/docs/what-a-call-can-establish.md) - Separating reachability from identity from the fact you wanted, why a third party vouching is never a pass, scoring challenges in code rather than asking the model to mark its own work, and the asymmetry rule for which error may be automatic.
- [`Design principles`](docs/design-principles.md) - Repository-wide architecture principles for safe phone-call workflows.
- [`Fail-closed dispositions`](plugins/zapier-calle/docs/fail-closed-dispositions.md) - Classifying phone-call outcomes so ambiguity, low confidence, and unrecognized statuses route to a human instead of a success branch.
- [`High-consequence identifier confirmation`](skills/warranty-recovery/references/identifier-confirmation.md) - Why extraction confidence cannot establish a claim, case or credit reference, and the read-back state machine that can: an affirmative answer grounded in the counterparty's own transcript turns, or no reference at all.
- [`CALL-E platform notes`](skills/warranty-recovery/references/calle-platform-notes.md) - What the Calls API guarantees and what it explicitly does not, including why `failure_code` must not drive retry or reporting, why there is no cancel operation, and what Goal Runs offer in exchange for moving the prompt and schema out of version control.
- [`Rehearse before you act`](docs/rehearse-before-you-act.md) - Why a structured result is a report to verify rather than a fact to act on: rehearsing a task against a scripted counterparty, putting world facts in the task, treating confidence as consistency rather than truth, and checking far-side values against the transcript turn they came from.
- [`Two agents agreeing is not a commitment`](apps/python/dialtone/docs/PROTOCOL.md) - DIALTONE v1: spoken agent-to-agent handshake, mode switch, and attestation labels that never upgrade `task_completed`.
